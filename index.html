          "I'm forever grateful to Mr. Krishna for his unwavering support and guidance throughout my CLAT 2019 journey. His constant mentorship, motivation, and encouragement helped me navigate the challenges and stay focused on my goal. His timely advice and counsel were instrumental in my success, and I was thrilled to have cleared CLAT and secured a seat at NLUS (National Law University Sonipat). Even after that, Mr. Krishna continued to support me, providing valuable insights and assistance with internships and more. Today, as a practicing lawyer in the Supreme Court of India, I'm a testament to the impact of his mentorship."
